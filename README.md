## Fluent YTM

A CSS modification to the YouTube Music PWA, making it look like a Windows-esque app. Complete with a sidebar inspired by the Microsoft Store.

This theme is inspired by @morpheusthewhite's [Fluent theme for Spicetify.](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Fluent) This is based on fakecore's ["YouTube Redesign" stylesheet](https://userstyles.org/styles/182294/youtube-music-desktop-redesign?utm_campaign=stylish_stylepage).

Tested on Microsoft Edge (Chromium) and should work on most (if not all) other Chromium-based browsers.

This CSS needs a **minimum** " viewport width" of **940px**, as the YouTube Music PWA overrides all CSS when it goes lower than that.

Not tested for the Electron-based [YTMDesktop](https://github.com/ytmdesktop/ytmdesktop) app.
